          Worked closely with NetSec engineers and the feature development team to debug and test fixes, including quick fixes for single customers, and long term fixes for the entire application.
            -	Fixed unicode decode issues with our EMEA clients which was causing errors due to character set differences not accounted for. I worked closely with Network Security engineers and senior Python developers
            to get up to speed on a language i was still learning, and implement a fix that we verified with the customer and would no longer impact customers from that market or any market with similar character differences.

          a full stack development feature that included calls to various Amazon services and using dependency injection in order to build the data we needed. I wrote code in HTML/CSS and Javascrip on the page's existing JSP to add a the container that will hold the new feature.lp from UI/UX to help implement accessibility features and language preferences. 
          - I lead initiatives when the Covid-19 pandemic began to keep the spirit of collaboration. I instituted bi-weekly “Happy Hours” during the last hour on Fridays for the time to unwind and have some fun. I also introduced a “Virtual Office Hour” for the team once a week so that everyone could hop on the same meeting and ask questions, chat, or just simply work while being with everyone virtually.

        company: Trux, Waltham MA

      - role: Full Stack Engineer
        time: May 2015 - April 2018
        company: Atos Syntel, Quincy MA
        details: |
          Joined Atos Syntel soon after graduating, and was assigned to the client State Street Bank. I worked on a team of full stack developers to develop 
          applications internally, with a focus on making legacy applications easier to use.
          - Wrote, deployed, and maintained a full stack application using Struts 2, HTML/CSS with Bootstrap, and Javascript with jQuery.
          Took ownership of designing a website that allowed bank employees to access legacy autosys scripts using a web application instead 
          of being forced to manually log into individual servers. Over two thousand scripts across hundreds of servers were onboarded to the 
          web application, simplifying the process and saving time.
          - Began the project to update our web application by using Spring to design RESTful web apis, and React to design a more modern and reactful front end. A user favorite's table was implemented using React and Axios combined with Spring as my last contribution to the project.
